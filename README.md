# Portfolio Site

## My portfolio site I made in HTML/CSS/JS

Hello, my name is Stevon Wright. At the time of writing this, January 2021, I am a high school senior. I have plans of going into the workforce as a professional software developer (not sure exactly what field, but most likely web development) once I gradutate. It is commonly recommended for every developer, especially if self-taught, to make their own website to showcase their skills and projects. This is why I am making this.

Website Link: Not yet available

Here are my goals for this project:

- [ ] Make a home page that has information about me and the skills I have
- [ ] Make a page to showcase projects and link to their GitHub repository (include title, picture and brief description)
- [ ] Make a page with contact form that allows the user to send me an email (possibly include categories to describe purpose of contact)
- [ ] Make a navigation bar that contains a title and/or logo and links to the website pages.
- [ ] Make a footer that contains links to my socials and the pages of the website.
- [ ] Make website easy to edit by making it fully modular (header and footer only written once, projects included dynamically through XML)
- [ ] Add attractive, responsive styling to pages, navbar, and footer
