## Tech Stack

-   HTML (actually JSX)
-   SASS
-   Javascript (React, Gatsby)

## How to Run

### Live App

Simply visit [https://stevon-wright.netlify.app](https://stevon-wright.netlify.app) to view this website.

### From Source

If you don't feel as though using the live website is enough for you, you can run my website from the source code in this respository with these steps:
**Note: Must have Node JS installed**

1. Open command line or terminal
2. Clone the repository with `git clone https://github.com/TeenageMutantCoder/portfolio-site`
3. Move into the directory with `cd portfolio-site`
4. Run `npm install`
5. Run `npm run start`, `npm run develop`, or `gatsby develop`. All 3 options should do the same thing.
